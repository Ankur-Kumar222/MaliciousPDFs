# MaliciousPDFs
This project focuses on building a machine learning (ML) model to predict the maliciousness of PDF files. By extracting relevant features from PDF files and utilising the ML algorithm, the goal is to create a robust model capable of identifying potentially malicious content with a low false positive rate, and a high detection rate.
